# Mailer

Mailing abstraction layer for [Hummingbird Lite](https://github.com/biohzrdmx/hummingbird-lite), with support for custom providers.

Other flavors (WordPress maybe?) coming soon!

## Basic usage:

### Creating the message

Mailer defines a `MailerMessage` class, which holds all the required fields to describe an email message.

Just include the library and create a `MailerMessage` instance, filling the desired fields:

	# Include the library and at least one provider
	include $site->baseDir('/external/mailer.inc.php');
	include $site->baseDir('/external/provider/mandrill.provider.php');
	include $site->baseDir('/external/provider/smtp.provider.php');

	# Create a MailerMessage object and set the subject, from, to, contents, attachments, etc.
	$message = MailerMessage::newInstance()
		->setSubject('Test')
		->setFrom( array('test@mailinator' => 'Me') )
		->setTo( array('test@mailinator' => 'Me') )
		->setTemplate($site->baseDir('/parts/mail-templates/basic-email.html'))
		->setImages(array('email_header' => $site->baseDir('/images/email-header.jpg')))
		->setAttachments(array('Test.doc' => $site->baseDir('/test.doc')))
		->setReplacements(array('%email-footer%' => 'Test'))
		->setContents('<h2>Hey you</h2>');

In the example above, we added a bunch of things, such as images, attached files, replacement strings, etc.

For each `MailerMessage` instance you may define:

- **Subject** - The message's subject
- **From** - The message's sender
- **To** - The message's destination
- **Contents** - The message's contents
- **Template** - An optional HTML template to use for the message
- **Attachments** - Attached files
- **Images** - Embedded images for inline display
- **Replacements** - String replacements for your template (for example, changing %site% for the URL of your site)

That way, we've defined an abstract message that could be sent by any provider we choose.

### Sending the message

Mailer includes two providers: classic SMTP and Mandrill

To send messages using the SMTP provider you should install the [PHPMailer library](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer) and pass the SMTP credentials through the `$options` array.

	$options = array(
		'host' => 'smtp.test.com',
		'port' => '587',
		'user' => 'smtp@test.com',
		'pass' => 'password123'
	);
	Mailer::send($message, 'smtp', $options);

*Pro tip: Download the PHPMailer ZIP and place `PHPMailerAutoload.php` and the three `class.*.php` files into `lib/PHPMailer`.*

Mandrill is even easier, you just need to install the [Mandrill PHP SDK](https://bitbucket.org/mailchimp/mandrill-api-php/downloads) and an API Key which you'll pass in the `$options` array.

	$options = array(
		'key' => 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'
	);
	Mailer::send($message, 'mandrill', $options);

*Pro tip: Download the Mandrill PHP SDK ZIP and extract the contents of the `src` folder into `lib/Mandrill`.*

And that kids, is how we send emails with Mailer.

## Extending the library

### Creating providers

You may refer to each of the bundled providers to see how they do work internally.

In short, you must:

- Create you provider class, extending `MailerProvider`
- Implement the `send` method in your derived class. This implementation depends on the specific provider mechanics.

We've included Mandrill and SMTP providers, but if you want to contribute by adding another provider (for example Swift Mailer or Mailgun, etc.) you're strongly encouraged to do so.

If you implement another provider please send me a push request so I can improve the providers pool.
